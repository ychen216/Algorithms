657. Judge Route Circle

/*
Initially, there is a Robot at position (0, 0). Given a sequence of its moves, judge if this robot makes a circle, which means it moves back to the original place.

The move sequence is represented by a string. And each move is represent by a character. The valid robot moves are R (Right), L (Left), U (Up) and D (down). The output should be true or false representing whether the robot makes a circle.

Example 1:
Input: "UD"
Output: true
Example 2:
Input: "LL"
Output: false
*/

Solution:
#include<string>
using namespace std;
class Solution {
public:
    bool judgeCircle(string moves) {
        int hor=0;//水平
        int ver=0;//垂直
        int len=moves.length();
        for(int i=0;i<len;i++){
            if(moves[i]=='U')
                ver++;
            else if(moves[i]=='D')
                ver--;
            else if(moves[i]=='L')
                hor--;
            else
                hor++;
        }
        if(hor==0&&ver==0)
            return true;
        else
            return false;
    }
};
