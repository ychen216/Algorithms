376. Wiggle Subsequence

/*
A sequence of numbers is called a wiggle sequence if the differences between successive numbers strictly alternate 
between positive and negative. The first difference (if one exists) may be either positive or negative. 
A sequence with fewer than two elements is trivially a wiggle sequence.

For example, [1,7,4,9,2,5] is a wiggle sequence because the differences (6,-3,5,-7,3) are alternately positive and negative.
In contrast, [1,4,7,2,5] and [1,7,4,5,5] are not wiggle sequences, the first because its first two differences are positive 
and the second because its last difference is zero.

Given a sequence of integers, return the length of the longest subsequence that is a wiggle sequence. 
A subsequence is obtained by deleting some number of elements (eventually, also zero) from the original sequence,
leaving the remaining elements in their original order.

Examples:
Input: [1,7,4,9,2,5]
Output: 6
The entire sequence is a wiggle sequence.

Input: [1,17,5,10,13,15,10,5,16,8]
Output: 7
There are several subsequences that achieve this length. One is [1,17,10,13,10,16,8].

Input: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
Output: 2

Solution 1:
class Solution {
public:
    //DP
    int wiggleMaxLength(vector<int>& nums) {
        int size=nums.size();
        if(size<=1)
            return size;
        int pos[size]={0},neg[size]={0};//该位应该的差值为正和负 最长的串长度
        pos[0]=1,neg[0]=1;
        for(int i=1;i<size;i++){
            int p=0,n=0;
            for(int j=0;j<i;j++){
                if(nums[j]<nums[i])
                    p=max(p,neg[j]);
                else if(nums[j]>nums[i])
                    n=max(n,pos[j]);
            }
            pos[i]=p+1;
            neg[i]=n+1;
        }
        return max(pos[size-1],neg[size-1]);
    }
};

Solution 2:
class Solution {
public:
    //利用贪心 将时间复杂度降为O(n)
    int wiggleMaxLength(vector<int>& nums) {
        int size=nums.size();
        if(size<=1)
            return size;
        bool prePos=false;//前一个序列是正
        int res=1;
        for(int i=1;i<size;i++){
            if(nums[i]>nums[i-1]&&(i==1||!prePos)){
                prePos=true;
                res++;
            }else if(nums[i]<nums[i-1]&&(i==1||prePos)){
                prePos=false;
                res++;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
