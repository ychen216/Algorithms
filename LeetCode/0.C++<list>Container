list是C++的一个sequence容器，具体实现是双向链表，iterator可以支持向前和向后prev(it),next(it)。支持对序列中任意位置O(1)时间内完成插入删除。
Elements in sequence containers are ordered in a strict linear sequence. 
Individual elements are accessed by their position in this sequence.

Lists are sequence containers that allow constant time insert and erase operations anywhere within the sequence, and iteration in both directions.
List containers are implemented as doubly-linked lists; Doubly linked lists can store each of the elements they contain in different and 
unrelated storage locations. The ordering is kept internally by the association to each element of a link to the element preceding it 
and a link to the element following it.


常用函数：
Iterators:
begin：Return iterator to beginning (public member function )
end：Return iterator to end (public member function )
rbegin:Return reverse iterator to reverse beginning (public member function )
rend:Return reverse iterator to reverse end (public member function )
cbegin :Return const_iterator to beginning (public member function )
cend ：Return const_iterator to end (public member function )
crbegin：Return const_reverse_iterator to reverse beginning (public member function )
crend ：Return const_reverse_iterator to reverse end (public member function )

Capacity:
empty：Test whether container is empty (public member function )
size：Return size (public member function )


Element access:
front
Access first element (public member function )
back

Modifiers:
emplace_front ：Construct and insert element at beginning (public member function )
push_front：Insert element at beginning (public member function )
pop_front：Delete first element (public member function )
emplace_back:Construct and insert element at the end (public member function )
push_back:Add element at the end (public member function )
pop_back:Delete last element (public member function )
emplace :Construct and insert element (public member function )
insert:nsert elements (public member function )
erase:Erase elements (public member function )
swap:Swap content (public member function )
resize:Change size (public member function )
clear:Clear content (public member function )

Operations:
splice:ransfer elements from list to list (public member function )
remove:Remove elements with specific value (public member function )
remove_if:Remove elements fulfilling condition (public member function template )
unique:Remove duplicate values (public member function )
merge:Merge sorted lists (public member function )
sort:sort elements in container (public member function )
reverse:Reverse the order of elements (public member function )
