231. Power of Two

/*
Given an integer, write a function to determine if it is a power of two.
*/
Solution:
class Solution {
public:
    //Power of 2 means only one bit of n is '1', so use the trick n&(n-1)==0 to judge whether that is the case
    bool isPowerOfTwo(int n) {
        return n>0&&!(n&(n-1));
    }
};
