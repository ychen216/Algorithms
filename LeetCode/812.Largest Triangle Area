812. Largest Triangle Area
/*
You have a list of points in the plane. Return the area of the largest triangle that can be formed by any 3 of the points.

Example:
Input: points = [[0,0],[0,1],[1,0],[0,2],[2,0]]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
The five points are show in the figure below. The red triangle is the largest.

Notes:
  3 <= points.length <= 50.
  No points will be duplicated.
  -50 <= points[i][j] <= 50.
  Answers within 10^-6 of the true value will be accepted as correct.

Solution:
class Solution {
public:
    //遍历所有三个点构成三角形 取面积最大的结果
    double largestTriangleArea(vector<vector<int>>& points) {
        double res=0.0;
        for(auto &a:points){
            for(auto &b:points){
                for(auto &c:points)
                    res=max(res,0.5*abs(a[0] * b[1] + b[0] * c[1] + c[0] * a[1]- b[0] * a[1] - c[0] * b[1] - a[0] * c[1]));
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};
