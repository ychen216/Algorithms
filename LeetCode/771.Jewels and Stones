771. Jewels and Stones
/*
You're given strings J representing the types of stones that are jewels, and S representing the stones you have. 
Each character in S is a type of stone you have.  You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

The letters in J are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in J and S are letters. Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".

Example 1:

Input: J = "aA", S = "aAAbbbb"
Output: 3
Example 2:

Input: J = "z", S = "ZZ"
Output: 0
Note:

S and J will consist of letters and have length at most 50.
The characters in J are distinct.

Solution:
class Solution {
public:
    int numJewelsInStones(string J, string S) {
        int lenj=J.length();
        if(lenj==0)
            return 0;
        unordered_set<char> sset;
        for(auto &j:J)
            sset.insert(j);
        int cnt=0;
        for(auto& s:S){
            if(sset.find(s)!=sset.end())
                cnt++;
        }
        return cnt;
    }
};
