667. Beautiful Arrangement II

/*
Given two integers n and k, you need to construct a list which contains n different positive integers ranging from 1 to n and obeys the following requirement: 
Suppose this list is [a1, a2, a3, ... , an], then the list [|a1 - a2|, |a2 - a3|, |a3 - a4|, ... , |an-1 - an|] has exactly k distinct integers.

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

Example 1:
Input: n = 3, k = 1
Output: [1, 2, 3]
Explanation: The [1, 2, 3] has three different positive integers ranging from 1 to 3, and the [1, 1] has exactly 1 distinct integer: 1.
Example 2:
Input: n = 3, k = 2
Output: [1, 3, 2]
Explanation: The [1, 3, 2] has three different positive integers ranging from 1 to 3, and the [2, 1] has exactly 2 distinct integers: 1 and 2.
Note:
The n and k are in the range 1 <= k < n <= 104.

Solution:
class Solution {
public:
    //dfs TLE
    /*
    注意到：1..n最多可以弄出n-1个不同的差，比如1..9就是
    * 1 9 2 8 3 7 4 6 5
    * diff: 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
    * 是大小交替的，这样的话，只要先凑出k-1个数，后面按照剩下的数递增或是递减顺序来产生1就好了
