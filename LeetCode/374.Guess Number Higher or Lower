374. Guess Number Higher or Lower

/*
We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number is higher or lower.

You call a pre-defined API guess(int num) which returns 3 possible results (-1, 1, or 0):
*/

Solution:
// Forward declaration of guess API.
// @param num, your guess
// @return -1 if my number is lower, 1 if my number is higher, otherwise return 0
int guess(int num);

class Solution {
public:
    //mynum是指正确答案
    int guessNumber(int n) {
        if(guess(n)==0)
            return n;
        int left=1,right=n,mid;
        while(left<right){
            mid=left+(right-left)/2;
            int res=guess(mid);
            if(res==0)
                return mid;
            else if(res==-1)
                right=mid-1;
            else
                left=mid+1;
        }
        return left;
    }
};
