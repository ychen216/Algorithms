263. Ugly Number

/*
Write a program to check whether a given number is an ugly number.

Ugly numbers are positive numbers whose prime factors only include 2, 3, 5. 
For example, 6, 8 are ugly while 14 is not ugly since it includes another prime factor 7.

Note that 1 is typically treated as an ugly number.

Solution:
class Solution {
public:
    //num只包含质因子2,3,5为ugly num,也就是除尽这些数还不为1的话 这个数还有别的质因子
    bool isUgly(int num) {
        if(num<=0)//要考虑这种情况 
            return false;
        while(num%2==0)
            num/=2;
    
        while(num%3==0)
            num/=3;
        
        while(num%5==0)
            num/=5;
        
        return num==1;
    }
};
