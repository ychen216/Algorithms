787. Cheapest Flights Within K Stops

/*
here are n cities connected by m flights. Each fight starts from city u and arrives at v with a price w.

Now given all the cities and fights, together with starting city src and the destination dst, 
your task is to find the cheapest price from src to dst with up to k stops. If there is no such route, output -1.

Example 1:
Input: 
n = 3, edges = [[0,1,100],[1,2,100],[0,2,500]]
src = 0, dst = 2, k = 1
Output: 200
Explanation: 
The cheapest price from city 0 to city 2 with at most 1 stop costs 200, as marked red in the picture.

Example 2:
Input: 
n = 3, edges = [[0,1,100],[1,2,100],[0,2,500]]
src = 0, dst = 2, k = 0
Output: 500
Explanation: 
The cheapest price from city 0 to city 2 with at most 0 stop costs 500, as marked blue in the picture.
Note:
  The number of nodes n will be in range [1, 100], with nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1.
  The size of flights will be in range [0, n * (n - 1) / 2].
  The format of each flight will be (src, dst, price).
  The price of each flight will be in the range [1, 10000].
  k is in the range of [0, n - 1].
  There will not be any duplicated flights or self cycles.

    //dp[i][k] stop<=k时src到i的最少花费 
    //dp[src][0]=0;dp[f[1]][0]=f[2] f为航线且f[0]=src即从src出发的航线
    //dp[i][k]=min(dp[i][k],dp[f[0]][k-1]+f[2]) f为航线
    int findCheapestPrice(int n, vector<vector<int>>& flights, int src, int dst, int K) {
        if(src==dst)
            return 0;
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n,vector<int>(K+1,INT_MAX));
        //初始化 k==0的情况
        dp[src][0]=0;
        //航线初始化
        for(auto &f:flights)
            if(f[0]==src)
                dp[f[1]][0]=min(dp[f[1]][0],f[2]);//避免有多条花费不同的相同航线 取最小值
        for(int k=1;k<=K;k++){
            //初始化
            for(int p=0;p<n;p++)
                dp[p][k]=dp[p][k-1];
            for(auto &f:flights)
                dp[f[1]][k]=min(dp[f[1]][k],dp[f[0]][k-1]+f[2]);
        }
        return dp[dst][K];
    }
};
